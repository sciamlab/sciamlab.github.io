In everyone's life experiences mediated by software occupy
an increasingly large portion of our day and basically what
is likely to increase over time. Despite happen constantly
before our eyes every time we use the phone to call home, 
the office computer, reading the newspaper on the tablet or
taking directions from the navigator in the car, we do not
realize that, willy-nilly leave a trace of ourselves and of
our actions in any system that records. 
The production of personal data that concern us and that we
allow or maybe we want to share and 'already started' for
several years, but the amount ', the frequency and spread
only recently has a trend that follows Moore's law, and then
and 'set to increase exponentially over time. Soon, Google will
make Glass' entry into the market and then in the lives of
many of us. A second wave after smartphones of tools that make
our experience mediated by the software more and more 'integrated
with every moment of our lives. Far from being a criticism,
this is to be a realization that our habits, our interests,
and much more of the personal sphere and 'destined to become
heritage of many other entities' wholly alien to us. It 's not
only the concept of privacy connotations that are taking more
and more' subtle but they are what we consider the basic elements
of our conception of society ', politics and human relations that
are transforming and accelerating are doing more every day' .

A lucid and fascinating reflection on these issues and contained 
in the book Who Owns the Future by Jaron Lanier that the creator of 
concepts such as virtual-reality and' back in their footsteps and even 
staying in the role of Silicon Boys, peers with a sharp criticism of 
the radical changes that the technology and software in particular 
have led to humanity.

We too are wondering about these issues and we teased the idea of 
​​talking about it here to open our blog. In these columns, we want 
to share what happens behind the scenes of opendatahub.it and 
discussions that animate our days while we reason as to make easier 
and more effective access to and use of open data available in Italy.

see you soon,
