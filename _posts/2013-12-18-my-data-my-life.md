In everyone's life, experiences mediated by software occupy
an increasingly large portion of our day and basically that
is likely to increase over time. Despite it happen constantly
before our eyes - every time we use the phone to call home, 
the office computer, reading the newspaper on the tablet or
taking directions from the navigator in the car - we do not
realize that willy-nilly we leave a trace of ourselves and of
our actions in any internediate system that records.
 
The production of personal data that concern us and that we
allow or maybe want share is 'already started' since
several years, but the amount, the frequency and spread
only recently assumed a trend that follows Moore's law so it's going
to increase exponentially over time. Google Glass is slowly approaching
into the lives of many of us. It's now time for a second and then a thrird
wave after smartphones and smartwatches of personal tools that make
our experience mediated by the software more and more "integrated
with every moment of our lives".

Far from being a criticism, this is to be a realization that our habits,
our interests, and much more of the personal sphere is 'destined to become
heritage of many other entities' wholly alien to us. It 's not
only the concept of privacy connotations that are taking more
and more' subtle but they are what we consider the basic elements
of our conception of society'.

A lucid and fascinating reflection on these issues is contained 
in the book [Who Owns the Future](http://www.jaronlanier.com/futurewebresources.html)
by Jaron Lanier that's the creator of 
concepts such as virtual-reality and' back in their footsteps and even 
staying in the role of Silicon Boys, peers with a sharp criticism of 
the radical changes that the technology and software in particular 
have led to humanity.

We are wondering about these issues and whetted us the idea of 
​​talking about it here to open our blog. In these columns, we want 
to share what happens behind the scenes of opendatahub.it and the
discussions that animate our days while we reason how to make easier 
and more effective access to the open data available in Italy.
