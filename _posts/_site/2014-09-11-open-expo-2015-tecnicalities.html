<p>In the last few weeks the The Superintendence for Archaeological Heritage of Pompeii, Herculaneum and Stabia under the guidance of the Institute of the Ministry of Heritage and Culture released <a href="http://open.pompeiisites.org/">http://open.pompeiisites.org/</a> the first open datasets with the entire tenders and work status details of the archeological sites. After just few days from the Open Pompei debut we released the new transparency portal for the Expo 2015 now available on <a href="http://www.openexpo2015.it">http://www.openexpo2015.it</a> Open Expo is the result of a massive effort coordinated by Giovanni Menduni from the Milan Polytechnic who see us involved with a quite large and heterogeneous team with members from Expo 2015 s.p.a., The Department of Statistic, Information and Application (DiSIA) of the University of Florence, Formez PA and Wikitalia who’s responsible and leading the entire initiative. Giovanni in <a href="http://www.chefuturo.it/2014/09/il-primo-selfie-bob-dylan-e-il-senso-di-openexpo-per-unitalia-migliore/">his post</a> made a great summary of the OpenExpo backgrounds and the spirit that animated the entire effort that bring it live in record time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile these two great italian initiaves While these Here we would just add few more technical details that could be beneficial form other similar initiatives aim with Our team concentrated on the setup and design of the CKAN Portal and the creation of the underlining databases behind the Expo 2015 open datasets. All the content originally come from a Google Sheet feeded collaborativelly and in record time by Expo’s personnel, periodically dumped into a MS Access and finally consolidated by us into a relational PostgreSQL schema. It was a continuos iterative process that went far beyond the most extreme programming practices as instead to be all around a desk we all worked remotelly on a shared online canvas where everyone was left (almost) completelly free to contribute with a clear and precise shared objective.</p>

<p>You can’t believe me, but the entire system has been built in approx a couple of weeks, mostly reusing what was already available on the dati.gov.it platform. It was a sleepless experience but finally we was able to make it going live for the planned date.</p>
