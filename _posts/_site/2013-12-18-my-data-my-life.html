<p>In everyone’s life, experiences mediated by software occupy an increasingly large portion of our day and basically that is likely to increase over time. Despite it happen constantly before our eyes - every time we use the phone to call home, the office computer, reading the newspaper on the tablet or taking directions from the navigator in the car - we do not realize that willy-nilly we leave a trace of ourselves and of our actions in any internediate system that records.</p>

<p>The production of personal data that concern us and that we allow or maybe want share is ‘already started’ since several years, but the amount, the frequency and spread only recently assumed a trend that follows Moore’s law so it’s going to increase exponentially over time. Google Glass is slowly approaching into the lives of many of us. It’s now time for a second and then a thrird wave after smartphones and smartwatches of personal tools that make our experience mediated by the software more and more “integrated with every moment of our livesi”.</p>

<p>Far from being a criticism, this is to be a realization that our habits, our interests, and much more of the personal sphere is ‘destined to become heritage of many other entities’ wholly alien to us. It ‘s not only the concept of privacy connotations that are taking more and more’ subtle but they are what we consider the basic elements of our conception of society’.</p>

<p>A lucid and fascinating reflection on these issues is contained in the book <a href="http://www.jaronlanier.com/futurewebresources.html">Who Owns the Future</a> by Jaron Lanier that’s the creator of concepts such as virtual-reality and’ back in their footsteps and even staying in the role of Silicon Boys, peers with a sharp criticism of the radical changes that the technology and software in particular have led to humanity.</p>

<p>We are wondering about these issues and we teased the idea of ​​talking about it here to open our blog. In these columns, we want to share what happens behind the scenes of opendatahub.it and the discussions that animate our days while we reason how to make easier and more effective access to the open data available in Italy.</p>

<p>see you soon, SciamLab Team</p>
